## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words
- Jordan P : Movies are engrained in our culture. Seeing how directors make the decisions they do based of the genre of the movie,the budget and other aspects. Seeing how these factors drive success at the box office is very interesting. The area im interested in this dataset is how a directors camera choice affects the box office success of a movie in its respected genre, asking questions like does a certain camera lead to more success in a genre? for example does a directors choose of camera directly correlate with the success of an action movie? this dataset can answer alot of these questions and allow us to find correlations between these factors. With data like this, movies can only keep getting better and better? right? maybe they all become the same. Exploring this topic can really shed light on the creativity of directors and if this creativity leads to success in the box office. 

I have revised my topic slightly and I am now going to be looking at the correlation between genre and budget of a film along with the directors whom yeld the hightest budgets. I will being answering the question do genres impact a films budget? how does popularity of a genre over time affect a films budget?

- Jordan R : I have shifted my topic slightly to see how the budget affects the type of medium selected. In the past digital may have been more expensive however as time has gone on digital has become increasingly cheap. Therefore I hypothesize that previously there may have been a correlation between budget and film medium, however as films become more modern I think that it will shift towards director preference as opposed to budgetary constraints. This will be very interesting to see how the medium of film shifted from a necessity to a style choice.

- Talon L : With the choice of shooting Films in the Movie Industry, I find the reasons behind the choice fascinating. The factors that can lead a director to choose between a specific medium (or an amalgamation of the two), can come down to multiple factors. That along with the Camera Type and the Genre of Film, there are multiple aspects to analyze when it comes to the way Movies have been shot. With this project, my interest lies within the choice of Camera between Directors and the use of a Specific Camera compared to the Budget of the Film. Along with that, the impact the Type of Genre can have on the choice of Camera or the Medium shot on is an interesting avenue to research. Sometimes it can come down to a Director's loyalty to a specific Brand/Type of Camera. Other times it can be influenced by a corporate decision. By seeing how many types of Cameras a director has used, it can be easier to get insight into the reason behind their choice. With this dataset, it allows us to see a variety of movies and the artistic/corporate influence behind their production and shooting.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words
The dataset `Film or Digital` was compiled by `The Pudding` and focuses on comparing the mediums movies were shot on. The list has been compiled from the `Top 100 Movies in the US Box Office` spanning from the years `2006-2017`. There are `1195 movies` included in the collection and it includes the `Movie Name`, the `Medium Used` (Film or Digital, sometimes a mixture of both), the `Director(s) of the Movie`, the `Budget`, `Camera(s) Used` and the `Genre of Movie`. There is also an additional dataset focusing on the `Top Directors` which have had a movie in the US Box Office Top 100 from 2006-2017 as well. Both datasets provide an in-depth perspective into the choice of Film or Digital factoring in many variables.
