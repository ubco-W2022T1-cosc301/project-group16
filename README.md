- Jordan R : I have shifted my topic slightly to see how the budget affects the type of medium selected. In the past digital may have been more expensive however as time has gone on digital has become increasingly cheap. Therefore I hypothesize that previously there may have been a correlation between budget and film medium, however as films become more modern I think that it will shift towards director preference as opposed to budgetary constraints. This will be very interesting to see how the medium of film shifted from a necessity to a style choice.
